## Inspiration

I liked the composition of this teacup scene, and I liked the saturated lighting, which are elements I used as indpiration in my project.
## External Resources
- For all of my SDFs, I referenced code from Inigo Quielez's website:
http://iquilezles.org/www/articles/distfunctions/distfunctions.htm
- To get soft shadows, I referenced Inigo Quielez's site again:
https://iquilezles.org/www/articles/rmshadows/rmshadows.htm
- I referenced Adam's subsurface example code to achieve the subsurface effect
